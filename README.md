# Hive-Piscine-C

This is my work from the Piscine at Hive Helsinki, in July 2023. This was the last stage of the application process for Hive, and was an intensive 4 week peer to peer learning experience.

I did a number of exercises to learn C fundamentals, including how to use and manipulate pointers, strings, and the basics of memory allocation. Most of this work was done individually, but the Rush and BSQ projects were all group collaborations with my peers.
